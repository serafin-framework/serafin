## Contribute to the project

It's a community project, so if you want to help, do not hesitate =)

If you want to contribute to the core modules, please discuss with us first then fork the repository and submit us a **Pull Request** with a lot of explanations. We will review it as soon as possible. Don't forget to cover your code with unit tests.

If you want to create a new generic module like a **Pipeline**, a **Pipeline Source** or a **Transport**, please follow our guidelines:

* If possible, do it in **Typescript** so you can generate proper .d.ts files.
* Create a plugin only if it accomplishes something unique and special.
* Follow this naming convention for your package name : *serafin-pipeline-[name]*, *serafin-transport-[name]*.


**/!\ Don't forget that it's not yet a stable version. Core modules can still change drastically...It's probably better to wait for the RC before commiting to much time on third party libraries.**
